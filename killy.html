            Blame! is set in what is simply known as "The City", a gigantic megastructure now occupying much of what used to be the Solar System. Its exact size is unknown, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutomu_Nihei">Tsutomu Nihei</a> suggested its diameter to be at least that of Jupiter's orbit, or about 1.6 billion kilometers. In the manga, this is also suggested by Killy crossing an empty, spherical room roughly the size of Jupiter, suggesting that the planet had been there but was disassembled as the City grew.

His cyberpunk-influenced artwork has gained a strong cult following worldwide.
